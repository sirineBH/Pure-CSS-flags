# Welcome to Flagtastic CSS Repository! ðŸš©ðŸŽ¨
Welcome to the realm of Flagtastic CSS, where we're turning lines of code into works of flag art!

## About This Repository
Here, we're on a mission to recreate flags of every country using nothing but the power of CSS. That's right, forget images, we're crafting these beauties pixel by pixel, line by line!

## Why CSS?
Why not? I love challenges, and what's more challenging (and fun!) than recreating intricate designs using only the tools at our disposal?

# Inspiration Source
I got this idea from CSS Battle #29.
