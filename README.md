# Welcome to Flagtastic CSS Repository! 🚩🎨
Welcome to the realm of Flagtastic CSS, where I'm turning lines of code into works of flag art!

## About This Repository
Here, I'm on a mission to recreate flags of every country using nothing but the power of CSS. That's right, forget images, I'm crafting these beauties pixel by pixel, line by line!

## Why CSS?
Why not? I love challenges, and what's more challenging (and fun!) than recreating intricate designs using only the tools at our disposal?

# Inspiration Source
I stumbled upon this idea while browsing [CSS Battle #29](https://cssbattle.dev/battle/29)
